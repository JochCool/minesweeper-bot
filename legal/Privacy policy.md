Preface: I am not a legal expert. "The Bot" refers to the Minesweeper Bot, a Discord application with ID `540917634695168010`.

The Bot does not store any personally identifying information. The only time any data is stored, is when a user successfully runs the "auto" command. In such an occasion, only the following data is stored:
* The ID of the channel in which the command was run, as provided by Discord.
* The exact point in time at which the command was run.
* The parameters that the user provided in the command.

This data is stored only for as long as it is needed for the command to work. As soon as the user successfully requests it to stop, this data will be deleted.

This data is stored on a Raspberry Pi that only the owner of the bot (one natural person) has access to. This data will never be shared with any third (or fourth, fifth, you get the point) party.

The Bot will always provide functionality for deleting stored data, but if there are any concerns (or general inquiries about data collection), the owner of The Bot can be contacted. There are various methods of contacting him. The recommended methods are:
* Joining [the Discord support server](https://discord.gg/PCxZrrZ);
* Sending a direct message on Discord to [@JochCool#1314](https://discord.com/users/206135024293117952) (user ID: `206135024293117952`);
* Opening [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/JochCool/minesweeper-bot/issues/new).

He can also be contacted through Twitter (@JochCool) or Reddit (u/JochCool) or whatever platform you can find him on.
