# Terms of service
Preface: I am not a legal expert. "The Bot" refers to the Minesweeper Bot, a Discord application with ID `540917634695168010`.

Do not use The Bot for anything illegal or anything that breaks Discord's Terms of Service (both of those aren't allowed anyway, you don't need this TOS to tell you that, also I'd be really impressed if you can use The Bot for anything illegal in the first place). Also no The Bot or its owner are not liable for any illegal or TOS-breaking activities because it's a fucking minesweeper bot.
